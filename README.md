# Introduction

Detonation Dash is a Top-Down 2D game where you control a car on a floating island.

Your goal in this game is to collect wrenches as soon as possible before your car explodes. There will be many obstacles and traps in your way, so every move counts.

I implemented different features: a car controller script, UI interfaces, Sound Effects, Particle effects, and Collectible items.

# Game Mechanics:

The game mechanics are pretty simple, you have both a health and energy bar, the health bar will decrease over time and the only way to prevent it from decreasing is by collecting all the wrenches which will give you a slight amount of health, and for the energy bar, it will decreases depending on your acceleration, stopping your acceleration will allow you to restore energy.

There are several items that spawn randomly throughout the level, there are currently 2 types of them: Speed Powerup and +1 Life, each one of them has a specific effect on your car, so you have to choose one wisely.

# User Interface:

I implemented a simple UI for the game, responsive for different screen sizes, you can track how many wrenches you collected and how much life is remaining, you can even see which powerup you currently have.

I believe having a good UI is really important in order for the player to have an enjoyable experience while playing your game.

# Conclusion:
Currently i really like the state of the game, but there are still many new contents i will add in the future.
